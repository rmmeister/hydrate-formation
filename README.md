# hydrate-formation

Using the equilibrium ratio approach, calculate the hydrate-formation pressure, Ph, for the
following gas mixture:
Component yi
CO2 0.002
N2 0.094
C1 0.784
C2 0.060
C3 0.036
i-C4 0.005
n-C4 0.019
Calculate Ph (in psia) at T = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 F using Sloanâ€™s correlation and
plot your results on a P-T diagram.
The experimentally observed hydrate-formation pressure is 325 psia at 50 F.
